This book was written as a way to give a more detailed exposition of the contents of the graduate level module in Computational Biomechanics, BN5205 in the Biomedical Engineering Department of the National University of Singapore. Credit for the content goes to Professor Alberto Corrias (for the numerical methods section) and Professor Martin Buist (for the Finite Element Method section). Each chapter begins with the relevant theory, and then applies the theory to a specific case study at the end of the chapter to aid understanding.

The first part of this book covers in detail numerical methods that can be used to solve differential equations of different types, all the way from first order ordinary differential equations to partial differential equations. This section ends off with a final assignment that tests all the numerical methods learnt in the first part cumulatively.

The second part of this book focuses on the implementation of the Galerkin finite element method as a way to model and computationally solve problems in biomechanics. We look at the underlying theory for the finite element method, as well as applications in the areas of heat transfer and elasticity to develop a generic idea of hoe to use the finite element method.
